PROBLEM:
Write a program to take two numbers as input and print their difference if the first number is greater than the second number otherwise
 print their sum.

INPUT:
First line will contain the first number (N1)
Second line will contain the second number (N2)

OUTPUT:
Output a single line containing the difference of 2 numbers (N1−N2)
 if the first number is greater than the second number otherwise output their sum (N1+N2).

CONSTRAINTS:
−1000≤N1≤1000
−1000≤N2≤1000

SAMPLE INPUT:
82
28

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
54
